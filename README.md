triggerwarden is a discord bot that connects to the nationstates sse api and sends a notification when a trigger updates.

### supports
- region triggers
- nation triggers
- population triggers (user/role whitelist only, contact Ducky on discord or ducky4life@duck.com)

it can also print out warning messages for liberations as a bonus

the bot restarts every 6 hours, so if it's down, wait a bit or message Ducky. shouldn't be down at update though.
